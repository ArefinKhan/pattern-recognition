Objective:
A set of training data is given. The data set contains two separate classes.

A set of test data is given. The objective is to devise an algorithm that can correctly classify the test data set.

Perceptron Algorithm:
This algorithm linearly classifies sets of data in to separate classes. The target is to find out a decision hyperplane that separates two linearly separable classes.

The current implementation is based on C++. There are three implementations:
1. The simple perceptron
2. The reward and punishment scheme
3. Pocket algorithm

The difference between 1 and 2 is subtle. Please see this link http://teacher.buet.ac.bd/mtirfan/courses/perceptron.html
